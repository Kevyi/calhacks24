**DO YOUR FNING WORK!**

Inspiration Because our friends always flake on things they say they're going to do. From studying to arriving on time. Our 4th group mate also decided to flake, leading to the creation of this app.

What it does Users can add tasks of goals they want to do which this app will hold on to. The kicker is that the user HAS to wager money on the task, and if they don't do it, they will lose that money to the proctor (their chosen friends). This adds a bit of spice to the game and creates more motivation to actually achieve something! Furthermore, the friend has the power to taunt you (and potentially motivate you even more).

How we built it We use React.JS for the front-end, Express.JS for the back-end, and MySQL for the database.

Challenges we ran into Honestly, it was learning all these new technologies on top of other complicated technologies such as Git (a lot of merge conflicts). We spent a lot of useless hours on menial tasks trying to figure out why our code wasn't working etc. Overall, the hours weren't spent with good productivity as a result.

Accomplishments that we're proud of Making a full-stack application that actually has some use. Not only does it motivates one to achieve their goals, it also (maybe) reinforces ones friendship (or destroy it).

What we learned Other than al the technologies, we learned how to work as a team from software architecting to actually implementing it. Overall, we had a fun time despite spending hours working on it (where most of the time we got stuck)!

What's next for Do Your F'n Work! Maybe implementing the Stripe API so we can use credit cards. Use AI for on-demand authentication. Export this premise into other task base management systems. Other than that, maybe a call/message function to taunt the users.
